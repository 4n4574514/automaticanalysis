Automated Analysis software was originally developed by Dr Rhodri Cusack
for supporting research at the MRC Cognition and Brain Science Unit. It
is made available to the academic community in the hope that it may
prove useful.

# About

aa is a pipeline system for neuroimaging written primarily in Matlab. It
robustly supports recent versions of SPM, as well as selected functions
from other software packages. The goal is to facilitate automatic,
flexible, and replicable neuroimaging analyses through a comprehensive
pipeline system.
